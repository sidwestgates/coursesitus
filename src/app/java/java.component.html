  <body><h1>Java Tutorial</h1>
  
  <h2>Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)</h2>
  <p>
    Visit the official Oracle website and download the latest version of JDK suitable for your operating system.
    Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation process.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 2: Set up Java Environment Variables</h2>
  <p>
    After installing JDK, you need to set up environment variables to enable the Java compiler and runtime to be accessible from the command line.
    On Windows, go to Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Environment Variables. Add a new system variable named <code>JAVA_HOME</code> with the path to your JDK installation directory (e.g., <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1</code>).
    Edit the <code>Path</code> system variable and append <code>%JAVA_HOME%\bin</code> to the end.
    On macOS and Linux, you can set the environment variables in the terminal by modifying the <code>.bash_profile</code> or <code>.bashrc</code> file.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 3: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h2>
  <p>
    While not mandatory, using an IDE can greatly enhance your productivity when writing Java code.
    Some popular choices include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans.
    Download and install your preferred IDE, following the instructions provided on their respective websites.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 4: Create a Java Project</h2>
  <p>
    Open your chosen IDE and create a new Java project.
    Choose a name for your project and specify the location where it will be stored on your computer.
    The IDE will create a basic project structure with a default Java class.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 5: Write Your First Java Program</h2>
  <p>
    Inside your project, locate the default class file usually named <code>Main</code> or <code>App</code> and open it.
    In the class, you'll find a <code>main</code> method, which is the entry point of your Java program.
    Replace the existing code in the <code>main</code> method with your own code.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Step 6: Run Your Java Program</h2>
  <p>
    Save the changes to your Java file.
    In your IDE, look for a "Run" or "Play" button to execute the program.
    Alternatively, you can compile and run the Java program from the command line.
    Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following commands:
